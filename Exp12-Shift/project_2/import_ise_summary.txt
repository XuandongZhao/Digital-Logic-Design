Note: During the import operation, any constraint file(s) that are found in the ISE project will be added to the current Vivado project.
      However, please note that none of these files will be automatically marked as a "Target Constraint File". To set a constraint file
      as target, select the file in the GUI "Sources" window, right-click on this file and then select "Set Target UCF". Alternatively,
      the target constraint file can be set using the "set_property target_constrs_file <filename> <fileset>" Tcl command.
